## ps_utilities

This is a set of PowerShell based utilities, created over time, with the idea of better shaping an SA/sysad/dev/DBA/SDE's perspective of what's going on under the covers on a Windows Server. These utilities are especially helpful in preparing for a migration, right-sizing exercises, or otherwise using forensics to troubleshoot problems with Windows servers.

There are some assumptions made within the code, but you can very easily make updates throughout by following comments in each of the utilities. 

These utilities have been tested on every Hyperscaler's IaaS platform, on-premises hardware, and nested virtualization. Each of these utilities are confirmed functioning as desired as of 2/2022 - however they are presented and provided without warranty, or statement of support.
